Type 1

Work /Check /Compare in PRE PHASE.
Then make recursive call which reduces search space every time.
It means work on the way up till you hit base case.

Then you just go on popping out recursive calls from call stack;

It's structure is similar to that of tail recursion

General Code Structure

public static void funcRec ( int n)
    {
        1: BASE CASE
            2: PRE PHASE WORK
            if ()
                do this
                        
        3: Recursive call                  
        funcRec (n+1);
    }
