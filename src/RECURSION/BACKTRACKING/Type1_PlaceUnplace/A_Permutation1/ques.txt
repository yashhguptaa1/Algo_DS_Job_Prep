1. You are give a number of boxes (nboxes) and number of non-identical items (ritems).
2. You are required to place the items in those boxes and print all such configurations possible.

Items are numbered from 1 to ritems.
Note 1 -> Number of boxes is greater than number of items, hence some of the boxes may remain empty.
