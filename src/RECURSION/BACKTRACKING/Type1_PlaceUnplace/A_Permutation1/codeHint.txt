1) rec call1(currItem,boxes [0,0,0,0],n,r) --> rec call1(currItem + 1,boxes [1,0,0,0],n,r)
2) for loop {each time from 0 to n} //Options boxslots


(n boxes) and number of non-identical items (ritems)

Each Level corresponds to each respective item
Mtlb as we go Depthvise, at each level , for a particular item
ITEM CHOOSES which BOXSLOT should it be placed in

The number of boxes denote the number of options ITEM can go in
It is denoted Breadthvise

ANS = nboxes P ritems

Since Number of items denote number of levels
and base cases are written to exit from level
when all items are taken care of

box[i] = 0 denotes empty box
any item can occupy current box

current Item has choosen box at ith place
no other item can select ith box

PLACE ITEM

Remaining Items have option of choosing from unmarked boxes
In next iteration curr item plans to choose some other box
different from box it already chose
if we dont do this then there will be two boxes with same item
also some other item will try to occupy current box in some other
permutation
box[i] = 0 denotes empty box

UNPLACE ITEM
