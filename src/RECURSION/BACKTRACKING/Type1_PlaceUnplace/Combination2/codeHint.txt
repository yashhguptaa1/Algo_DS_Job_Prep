1. Make Base case from LEVEL :depthvise
2. Make Loop from OPTIONS :breadthvise

To stop this code from behaving like permutation
we ensure the next item selects boxes remaining after last visited box
vrna 1 2 - -
ka  2 1 - - bhi chl jayega
BASICALLY HUM IS CODE ME BACKTRACK KRTE HUE YEH ENSURE KRTE HE KI
FIRSE SAME INDEX PR NA JAAYEIN

since i already know by using lastBoxVis+1
i ensure i always go to empty box
so no need to check if box is empty or not
it works perfectly without this if condition
if(boxes[b] == false){
