1)LEVEL = NODES
    i) nth level is same as Answer (Result) of nth subproblem
    or answerSoFar for nth subproblem

    ii) int countPaths = 0;
        Used in PREORDER Phase
        to store answerSoFar for nth subproblem


2) OPTIONS = BRANCHES
   (i-1) + (i-2) + (i-3) + .... + (i-j)
   where j is the number of all possible options

3)  During PostOrder Phase
        Count variable initialized during PREOERDER phase at each level
        is used to store count of all paths via that node

                countPaths+=PathsfromCurrNode;


4) In DP we can think it of as
    Using conitinuous indexes(most recent subproblems) to solve current subproblem
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3];
