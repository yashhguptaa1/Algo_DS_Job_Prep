ArrayList is a DS that gives us full freedom to work on data as we need
we can add / delete/ modify /at any index
we can manipulate and add any kind of random data

STACKS AND QUEUES
are more disciplined kind of DS
they allow add / delete / modify only under certain condition
on top of that they are used to store HISTORIES rather than any random data
cauz then only will stack and queue would be able to fullfill its purpose
