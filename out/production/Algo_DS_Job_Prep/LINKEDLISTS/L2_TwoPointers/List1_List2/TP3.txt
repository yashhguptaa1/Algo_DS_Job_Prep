Two Pointer Approach

You are either given two Linked list or you create two linked list
use t1 (prev) ptr to traverse LL1
use t2 (curr) ptr to traverse LL2
keep track of nextNode before hand that is either check for null pointer or store the nextNode in ptr
before moving your current ptr forward

Also Create a DummyHeadNode as chances are you would lose head and its next will point to any one of the LLs head
