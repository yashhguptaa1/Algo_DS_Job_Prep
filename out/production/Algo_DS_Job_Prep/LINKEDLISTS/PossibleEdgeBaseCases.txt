1)Edge Case
 We can be given an empty List or a list with only single element
 Soln : check
  if(head ==null || head.next == null)
     return;

 Base Case
 Our code iterates to end of LL and points to null
 we must return either some node(generally null or last node of LL)
 or return void
 Soln : check
 if(node ==null)
    return;


2)Chances are when its asked in question you have to delete ans node you might have to delete head node
    Also,Chances maybe your code will result in losing head pointer or end up changing it

    Soln:
    ListNode dummyHeadNode=new ListNode(-1);
    ListNode left=dummyHeadNode;
    dummyHeadNode.next=head;

    //after whole code executes
    return dummyHeadNode.next;

3) Edge Cases to check your program on

    TO DETERMINE BASE CASE
    i)empty list
    ii)one sized list
    iii)two sized list

    TO CHECK If YOUR CODE WORKS CORRECTLY
    iv)even sized list
    v)odd sized list
