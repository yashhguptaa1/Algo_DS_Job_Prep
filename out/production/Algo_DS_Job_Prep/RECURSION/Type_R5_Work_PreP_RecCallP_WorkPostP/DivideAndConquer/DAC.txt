1) In PRE PHASE
    Decide the factor on the basis of which you would divide your subproblems into two
    i) Can be mid index of array (any DS)
        Merge Sort
    ii)Can be pivot index of array(any DS)
        Quick Sort

2) In CALL PHASE
    Make Recursive Calls (Two Recursive Calls)
    that point to two different subproblems of main problem
    The updated argument to be passed in these recursive calls
    is decided by the FACTOR obtained above

   Also
   If there is a return type Initialize variables to store answers of
