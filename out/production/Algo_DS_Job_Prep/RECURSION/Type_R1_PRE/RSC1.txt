Type 1

1) Start from main call

2) BASE CASE
    It is implemented only to stop recursion
    and pop out all recursive calls from Call Stack

3) In PRE PHASE
    i)Questions in Print_in_PrePhase
        Print the ans obtained so far as you go up

    ii)Questions in Return_in_PrePhase
        We return the answer in PrePhase as soon as we get the desired answer
        and exit from Call Stack



Work /Check /Compare in PRE PHASE.
Then make recursive call which reduces search space every time.
It means work on the way up till you hit base case.

Then you just go on popping out recursive calls from call stack;

It's structure is similar to that of tail recursion

        funcRec (n+1);
    }
