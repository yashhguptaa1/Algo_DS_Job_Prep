CAN BE COMMONLY SEEN IN BINARY TREES QUESTIONS

TWO RECURSIVE CALL MULTIPLE PHASES
EXTENSION OF Type_R1 AND Type_R2 COMBINED

YOU MAKE TWO RECURSIVE CALL in same code

your code gets divided into parts as

1) BASE CASE

2) PREPHASE : work here

3) LEFT RECURSIVE CALL (based on recursive tree diagram)

4) IN PHASE : work here

5) RIGHT RECURSIVE CALL (based on recursive tree diagram)

6) POST PHASE : work here


EXAMPLE

public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        pzz(n);
    }

    public static void pzz(int n)
    {
        if(n == 0)
            return;

        System.out.print(n + " ");
        pzz(n-1);
        System.out.print(n + " ");
        pzz(n-1);
        System.out.print(n + " ");
    }
