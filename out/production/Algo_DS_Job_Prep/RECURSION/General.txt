WHICH IS RECURSUVE TREE DIAGRAM IN WHICH

NODES : CURRENT RECURSIVE CALL
BRANCHES : NUMBER OF TIMES RECURSIVE FUNCTION CALLED FROM CURRENT FUNC
            : OPTIONS /CHOICES

WE MAKE TREE WHERE MAIN CALL NODE IS AT BOTTOM AND BASE CALL NODES AT TOP
AS THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN STACK
